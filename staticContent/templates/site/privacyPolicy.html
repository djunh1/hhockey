                            <li><strong>What is "Do Not Track" ?</strong>  Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference
                                that any user can set as a preference in their web browsers. The United States
                                Federal Trade Commission has endorsed DNT and California enacted a bill (AB370) that
                                lets the sites you visit know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of
                                information about you across services that you have either directly or indirectly
                                interacted with while on the page. The DNT browser setting is now supported by recent
                                versions of major browsers, including Firefox 5+, Internet Explorer 9+, Safari 5.1+, and Chrome.</li>

                            <li> We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we

                                a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.  Here is how it works:  when you
